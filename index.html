          “ I've been interested in coding for a while but never taken the jump,
          until now. I couldn't recommend this course enough. I'm now in the job
          of my dreams and so excited about the future. ” Tanya Sinclair UX
          Engineer “ If you want to lay the best foundation possible I'd
          recommend taking this course. The depth the instructors go into is
          incredible. I now feel so confident about starting up as a
          professional developer. ”
